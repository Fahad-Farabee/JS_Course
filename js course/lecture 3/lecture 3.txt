Loops in JS:
-------------
loops are used to execute a piece of code again and again

1.//for loops
for(let i = 1; i<= 5; i++){
    console.log("hello");
}
//let i = 1 -> initialiazation
//i<=5 -> stopping condition
//i++ -> updation


2. while loops:
->initialization
while(condition -> stopping condition){
code to be executed;
->updations
}
3. do while loops:
do{
code to be executed;
}while(condition);
works at least one time;

4.for-of loop:
it is used in strings and arrays
for (let val of strVal){
	code to be executed;
}

5.for-in loop:
it is used in objects and arrays
for (let key in objVar){
	code to be executed;
}
